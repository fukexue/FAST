## Model Use (from [CLIP Model Card](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14))

### Intended Use

The model is intended as a research output for research communities. We hope that this model will enable researchers to better understand and explore zero-shot, arbitrary image classification. We also hope it can be used for interdisciplinary studies of the potential impact of such models - the CLIP paper includes a discussion of potential downstream impacts to provide an example for this sort of analysis.

#### Primary intended uses

The primary intended users of these models are AI researchers.

We primarily imagine the model will be used by researchers to better understand robustness, generalization, and other capabilities, biases, and constraints of computer vision models.

### Out-of-Scope Use Cases

**Any** deployed use case of the model - whether commercial or not - is currently out of scope. Non-deployed use cases such as image search in a constrained environment, are also not recommended unless there is thorough in-domain testing of the model with a specific, fixed class taxonomy. This is because our safety assessment demonstrated a high need for task specific testing especially given the variability of CLIPâ€™s performance with different class taxonomies. This makes untested and unconstrained deployment of the model in any use case currently potentially harmful. 


Since the model has not been purposefully trained in or evaluated on any languages other than English, its use should be limited to English language use cases.
